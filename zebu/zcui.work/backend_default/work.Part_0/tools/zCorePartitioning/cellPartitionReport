# The partition of the cell is marked by '*'.
# The cell resource size which is larger than partition size * $ZEBU_CELL_REPORT_SIZE_THRES will be marked by '**'.
### 1. Collect cells that have ratio of (internal-cuts/total cuts) < 0.5, the ratio is 0.5 by default, and can be set by env(ZEBU_CELL_REPORT_INCUT_THRES).
### 2. Collect cells whose size are bigger than partition size * 0.2(0.2 by default), and can be set by env(ZEBU_CELL_REPORT_SIZE_THRES).
# Only print 0 cell instances based on above constraints.
